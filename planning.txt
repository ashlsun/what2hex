planning flow of program
  
right now the program assumes that if you enter something in binary, you want it in decimal, 
and if you enter something in hex, you want it in hex. i would like to allow threeway conversions 
and have them be as convenient as possible but with 6 possible directions the computer cannot 
make assumptions which conversions people actually want. this is me trying to figure out what
flow would be needed for this to work.

  bh
  hb
  bd
  db
  hd
  dh

always prompt a value, unless user has quit
"q" to quit, "d" to switch to to dec mode, "bh" tp switch to bin/hex mode

in bin/hex mode:
  prompt "[bin <-> hex] enter value: "
    if input is bin, convert to hex
    if input is hex, convert to bin
    if input is dec, ask "convert to bin or hex? (enter 'b' or 'h')"

in dec mode:
  prompt "[? --> dec] enter value: " and always convert to dec
